## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

### Why MCP?

Understand the motivation and benefits of using MCP:

### LLM Chatbot

Hands-on examples using function tool calling with different providers:

- 🤖 **ChatBot using Anthropic**  
  [`tool_calling_anthropic_chatbot.ipynb`](/cookbooks/chatbots/tool_calling_anthropic_chatbot.ipynb)

- 🤖 **ChatBot using OpenAI**  
  [`tool_calling_openai_chatbot.ipynb`](/cookbooks/chatbots/tool_calling_openai_chatbot.ipynb)

### Creating MCP Server

Hands-on guide to creating an MCP server:
- 🖥️ **Creating an MCP Server**  
  [`mcp_server.ipynb`](/cookbooks/mcp_server.ipynb) - This example aligns with exposing the tools via the MCP server.

### Creating MCP Client

Hands-on guide to creating an MCP client:
- 🖥️ **Creating an MCP Client**
  [`mcp_client.ipynb`](/cookbooks/mcp_client.ipynb) - This example aligns with consuming the tools via the MCP client. Additionally, They contains the steps to run the MCP client and interact with the MCP server using LLMs.


**Contributions Welcome!**  
If you’d like to add examples using other providers or open-source models, feel free to open a pull request. I’ll review and merge it.

## Learning Resources

I’m learning MCP through a free course by **DeepLearning.AI** and **Anthropic** (creators of MCP):
